Drying time depends on materials, saturation level, airflow, humidity, and access.

## Typical ranges
- Minor localized loss: 2–3 days
- Moderate loss: 3–5 days
- Heavier saturation / multi-room: 5–7+ days

## What matters most
- Proper equipment sizing (air movers + dehumidification)
- Moisture mapping and monitoring
- Controlled containment when needed

We verify dryness with moisture readings—not guesses.
