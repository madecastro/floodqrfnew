When water hits, **time is everything**. Here’s a practical checklist to reduce damage and protect your claim.

## First: safety
- Shut off water at the source if possible.
- If there’s standing water near outlets, shut power off at the breaker.
- Avoid contaminated (Category 3) water—call pros.

## Then: stop the spread
- Move rugs, textiles, and valuables to a dry area.
- Blot—don’t rub—wet surfaces.
- If safe, start ventilation.

## Document early
- Wide and close photos
- Notes on when you discovered the loss
- Any emergency steps you took
