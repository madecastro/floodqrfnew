## Why documentation matters

When you have water damage, insurance carriers and adjusters typically need clear proof of **cause, scope, and actions taken**. The more organized your documentation is, the faster decisions tend to move.

## Quick checklist

- Photos/video of the affected areas **before** work begins
- Photos of the source (supply line, drain line, appliance, roof, etc.)
- Moisture readings and daily logs (if drying is involved)
- Itemized list of damaged materials and contents
- Receipts (hotel, meals, emergency purchases if applicable)
- Any prior mitigation invoices and work authorizations

## Pro tip

Start a single folder on your phone called **"Flood QRF - Claim"** and drop everything in there. It makes follow-ups much easier.
